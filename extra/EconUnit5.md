##Chapter 15 Money in Our Economy

###I. What Kinds of Money Do We Use?
####Currency
#####Money issued by the federal government (else counterfeiting)
**Coins and Paper Currency** are notes issued by the Federal Reserve System

*United States notes* are issued by the Treasury Department
#####Checks
Most transactions are paid for by check.

*Demand deposit* - the bank promises to pay the owner of the deposit's demands

*Negotiable order of withdrawl (NOW)* - a checkable account with interest

*Traveler's Checks* - widely accepted checks
###II. Monetary Standards In United States History
*Monetary Standard* - what a community chooses as money

Before 1900s, the U.S. was using gold and silver

During the early 1900s, the U.S. was on the gold standard

The Great Depression caused the U.S. to modify the gold standard by forcefully buying people's gold with paper currency and then raising the price of gold

The paper currency backed up by gold was removed in 1971 for an all *paper money standard* or *fiat currency standard*
###III. Measuring the Nation's Money Supply
Economists are trying to measure the nations's economy through cash flow

Because some money is off hand while other money is delayed, economists created three different measures

**M1** - money that is the easiest medium of exchange (currency, checking accounts, etc)

**M2** - money less convertible to cash (savings accounts, money market funds, deposit accounts, CDs, etc)

**M3** - includes larger CDs, Eurodollars, and other large funds that take longer than M2
